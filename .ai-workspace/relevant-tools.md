# Relevant Tools for Current Context

*Dynamically updated based on task detection*

## Primary Tools (High Relevance)

### File Operations
- `write` - Create/overwrite files
- `search_replace` - Edit existing files precisely
- `mcp_filesystem_read_file` - Read file contents

### Version Control
- `git status` - Check current changes
- `git diff` - Review modifications before commit
- `git commit` - Save changes with message

## Secondary Tools (Contextually Useful)

### Architecture & Planning
- **Scratchpad** (`.ai-workspace/scratchpad/`)
  - Draft complex designs before implementing
  - Explore alternatives without touching code
  
- **Memory** (persist across sessions)
  - Document architectural decisions
  - Record "why" behind choices
  - Track learnings and patterns

### Git Advanced
- `git stash` - Save work-in-progress
- `git branch -b <name>` - Create experiment branch
- `git add -p` - Stage selectively

## Currently Not Needed

These tools are available but not relevant to current context:
- Browser/Playwright (no web testing needed)
- NixOS package search (not doing system config)
