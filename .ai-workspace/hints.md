# Contextual Hints

*Auto-updated based on detected task context*

## Architecture Design Mode

💡 **Memory**: Document key architectural decisions so they persist across sessions
💡 **Scratchpad**: Draft complex designs in `.ai-workspace/scratchpad/` before implementing
💡 **Git**: Consider creating an experiment branch for major structural changes

## Development Reminders

📝 **Before major changes**: Create a checkpoint with `git stash` or WIP commit
📝 **After decisions**: Use memory to record "why" not just "what"
📝 **Complex tasks**: Break into plan with checkpoints

## Underutilized Tools

These tools are available but often forgotten:

| Tool | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `git stash` | Save work-in-progress without committing |
| `git add -p` | Stage changes selectively (hunks) |
| `git branch` | Create experiment branches for risky changes |
| Memory | Store decisions, preferences, learnings |
| Scratchpad | Draft ideas before touching real code |
