You are working on the nixos-cursor repository maintenance tasks.

Repository: /home/e421/nixos-cursor
Current Branch: pre-release

Your job is to work through the tasks in MAINTENANCE_TASKS.md systematically.

## Ground Rules

1. **Safety First**: 
   - DO NOT modify any code logic
   - DO NOT run git push, git merge, or git reset
   - DO NOT delete files without explicit confirmation
   - DO NOT touch anything in tools/cursor-proxy/ or tools/cursor-agent-tui/

2. **Documentation & Cleanup Only**:
   - README updates
   - Comment additions
   - gitignore fixes
   - Branch status reports
   - TODO/FIXME inventory

3. **Report, Don't Fix**:
   - For complex issues, document them clearly
   - Include file paths, line numbers, and context
   - Recommend actions but don't execute them

4. **Git Operations**:
   - git status - OK
   - git diff - OK
   - git log - OK
   - git add <file> - OK (for documentation changes only)
   - git commit - ASK FIRST with full message preview
   - git push - NEVER (the user will push)

## Task Workflow

For each task:

1. Read the task description in MAINTENANCE_TASKS.md
2. Investigate the files/directories mentioned
3. Document your findings
4. If making changes, use git add to stage
5. Report completion in the format shown in MAINTENANCE_TASKS.md

## Start Here

Begin with Task 1.1 (README review). When complete, move to Task 1.2, and so on.

Work through all 🟢 Easy tasks first, then 🟡 Medium tasks.

Skip any 🔴 Complex tasks - leave those for Claude.

## Output Format

After completing a section, provide a summary like:

```
## Category 1 Complete

### Task 1.1 - README Review
Status: ✅ Complete
Findings:
- Found outdated version reference (line 45)
- Missing cursor-isolation mention
Changes: None (just documented)

### Task 1.2 - CONTRIBUTING.md
Status: ⚠️ Issues Found
Findings:
- File exists but needs new section
Staged Changes:
- CONTRIBUTING.md (added isolation workflow section)
```

## Current Known Issues

1. `gorky-neon.json` had invalid JSON - FIXED (extra `}` removed)
2. Several untracked directories need review
3. result-* symlinks should be gitignored

Good luck! Be thorough but safe.
