# RC3 Forum Update - Talking Points

## Main Message
"RC3 is live with a multi-version manager! Run Cursor 2.0.77, 1.7.54, and 2.0.64 side-by-side with isolated configs. No more being forced to upgrade and lose custom modes."

## Key Features to Highlight
1. GUI version manager (launch different versions easily)
2. Direct S3 URLs (DNS issues resolved)
3. Isolated user data (each version has its own settings/custom modes)
4. Config sync (settings/keybindings auto-sync across versions)
5. Experimental docs sharing (opt-in globalStorage symlink)

## Quick Start Commands
```bash
nix run github:Distracted-E421/nixos-cursor#cursor-manager
nix run github:Distracted-E421/nixos-cursor#cursor-2_0_77
```

## What Was Fixed Since RC2
- DNS failures (all packages now use S3 URLs)
- $HOME expansion bug (was breaking isolated configs)
- GUI theming (now matches Cursor's light/dark mode)
- Data sync (automatic settings/keybindings sync)

## Credits
"Special thanks to @oslook for cursor-ai-downloads repo with reliable direct links"

## Call to Action
"Try RC3 if you've been affected by custom modes deprecation. Report issues on GitHub."

## TLDR
"We built tools to keep using Cursor 2.0.77 with custom modes while accessing other versions as needed."
