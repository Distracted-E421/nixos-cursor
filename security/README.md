# NPM Security Module

> **Protecting nixos-cursor users from npm supply chain attacks**

This module provides defense-in-depth security for npm packages used by MCP servers.

## 🚨 Why This Matters

MCP servers pull npm packages that have **deep dependency trees**:

| Package | Transitive Dependencies |
|---------|------------------------|
| `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` | 129 packages |
| `@modelcontextprotocol/server-github` | 46 packages |
| `@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory` | 15 packages |

**Any one of these packages could be compromised** (as demonstrated by the Shai-Hulud attacks in November 2025).

## 🛡️ Features

### 1. Blocklist Enforcement

Known malicious packages are blocked before they can execute:

```bash
# Check if a package is blocked
cursor-security check event-stream
# ❌ BLOCKED: event-stream is on the blocklist
```

### 2. Integrity Verification

Lockfiles with SRI hashes ensure packages haven't been tampered with:

```bash
# Generate lockfile for a package
cursor-security generate-lockfile @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
```

### 3. Pattern Scanning

Scan packages for suspicious patterns before installation:

```bash
# Scan a package for IOC patterns
cursor-security scan @some/suspicious-package
```

### 4. CI/CD Integration

GitHub Actions workflow automatically scans all MCP packages on every PR.

## 🔧 Usage

### In Home Manager

```nix
programs.cursor = {
  enable = true;
  mcp = {
    enable = true;
    # Security is enabled by default
    security = {
      enable = true;  # default: true
      scanBeforeInstall = true;  # default: true
      blocklist = [
        # Add custom blocked packages
        "suspicious-package"
      ];
    };
  };
};
```

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Show security status
cursor-security status

# Scan a package
cursor-security scan @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem

# Check blocklist
cursor-security check event-stream

# Generate lockfile
cursor-security generate-lockfile @modelcontextprotocol/server-github

# Audit cached packages
cursor-security audit
```

## 🗄️ Blocklist Format

The blocklist is a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "lastUpdated": "2025-11-27T00:00:00Z",
  "packages": {
    "category_name": {
      "description": "Category description",
      "packages": [
        {
          "name": "package-name",
          "versions": ["1.2.3", "*"],
          "reason": "Why it's blocked",
          "cve": "CVE-2021-xxxxx",
          "discovered": "2021-01-01"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔄 Updating the Blocklist

The blocklist is updated with nixos-cursor releases:

```bash
# Update your flake to get latest blocklist
nix flake update
```

To report a malicious package, open an issue or PR at:
<https://github.com/e421/nixos-cursor/issues>

## 🧪 Testing

The security module includes comprehensive test suites written in **Nushell** (preferred) with bash fallbacks:

### Nushell Tests (Recommended)

```nu
# Run all tests (offline)
nu security/tests/run-all-tests.nu

# Run all tests including network tests
nu security/tests/run-all-tests.nu --network

# Run individual test suites
nu security/tests/test-blocklist.nu    # Blocklist validation
nu security/tests/test-scanner.nu      # Scanner pattern detection
nu security/tests/test-scanner.nu --network  # Include live package scanning
```

### Bash Tests (Legacy)

```bash
# These exist for compatibility but Nushell versions are preferred
./security/tests/run-all-tests.sh
./security/tests/test-blocklist.sh
./security/tests/test-scanner.sh --with-network
```

### Test Coverage

- **Blocklist Tests**: 64 tests validating blocklist structure, malicious package detection, and false positive prevention
- **Scanner Tests**: Pattern detection, install script identification, synthetic malware detection
- **Network Tests**: Real-world validation against npm packages (requires --with-network)

### Whitelisting

Known-legitimate pattern usage is documented in `tests/whitelist.json`. This prevents false positives for packages that legitimately use patterns that might otherwise trigger warnings (e.g., GitHub MCP server using base64 for API responses).
