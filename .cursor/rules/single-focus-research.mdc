# Single-Focus Research and Implementation Rule

## 🎯 **Purpose**

Maintain information integrity and veracity by focusing on one topic at a time when research requires deep accuracy.

---

## 📋 **The Rule**

### **When Working on Complex Topics:**

**IF** the AI assistant cannot use the browser tool to cross-reference information between multiple documents:

**THEN** focus on **ONE topic at a time** to prevent:

- Information cross-contamination
- Incorrect assumptions from multiple contexts
- Degraded information integrity
- Long-term strategic hindering

### **Examples of Complex Topics:**

1. **Technical Research:**
   - CPU offloading strategies
   - Kubernetes architecture comparisons
   - Network bandwidth optimization
   - Quantization quality assessments

2. **Strategic Planning:**
   - Infrastructure decision making
   - Multi-system orchestration planning
   - Long-term architecture design

3. **Cross-System Integration:**
   - Home Assistant + AI integration
   - Multi-device resource sharing
   - Distributed compute strategies

---

## ✅ **How to Apply This Rule**

### **Single-Focus Workflow:**

1. **Choose One Topic:**
   - Pick a single strategy, technology, or question
   - Example: "Strategy 1D - CPU Core Partitioning"

2. **Deep Dive:**
   - Research thoroughly on that ONE topic
   - Create comprehensive documentation
   - Answer all related questions
   - Test or simulate where possible

3. **Complete Before Moving:**
   - Finish documentation
   - Commit changes
   - Mark as "researched" or "complete"
   - ONLY THEN move to next topic

4. **Avoid Topic Mixing:**
   - Don't jump between Kubernetes and CPU offloading in same session
   - Don't mix hardware research with software framework research
   - Keep contexts clean and isolated

---

## 🚫 **What NOT To Do**

### **Anti-Patterns That Degrade Quality:**

❌ **Don't:** Research 5 different CPU offloading strategies in one response
✅ **Do:** Research Strategy 1A completely, document it, then move to 1B

❌ **Don't:** Compare k3s vs k0s vs Ray vs vLLM all at once
✅ **Do:** Deep dive on k3s first, then k0s separately, then Ray

❌ **Don't:** Mix network bandwidth research with quantization benchmarking
✅ **Do:** Complete network research, commit docs, then start quantization

---

## 🔄 **Exceptions: When Multi-Focus is OK**

### **Browser Tool Available:**

If the AI assistant can use `mcp_cursor-playwright` browser tools:

- ✅ Can research multiple topics in parallel
- ✅ Can cross-reference between sources
- ✅ Browser provides fresh, verified information

### **Simple Updates:**

For non-research tasks:

- ✅ Updating multiple changelogs
- ✅ Fixing multiple typos across files
- ✅ Applying same pattern to multiple configs

### **Related Sub-Topics:**

When topics are tightly coupled:

- ✅ Researching GPU offloading AND the specific GPU's architecture
- ✅ Documenting a strategy AND its implementation steps
- ✅ Testing performance AND documenting results

---

## 📊 **Quality Metrics**

### **Success Indicators:**

- ✅ Each document is accurate and complete
- ✅ No contradictory information between documents
- ✅ Research is thorough, not superficial
- ✅ Recommendations are based on solid understanding
- ✅ User can trust the information for decision-making

### **Failure Indicators:**

- ❌ Information conflicts between documents
- ❌ Superficial coverage of multiple topics
- ❌ User has to fact-check every claim
- ❌ Long-term strategic decisions hindered by bad info
- ❌ Need to redo research later

---

## 🎯 **Current Application**

### **Active Research Topics (Do One at a Time):**

1. **CPU Core/RAM Partitioning** (Strategy 1D)
2. **k3s vs k0s Decision** (Kubernetes)
3. **Quantization Benchmarking** (Strategy 7)
4. **Network Bandwidth Testing** (Foundation for Strategy 2/3)
5. **framework CPU Performance** (Strategy 2A)
6. **Wake-on-LAN Research** (Strategy 4A)
7. **Ray vs K8s Evaluation** (Infrastructure)
8. **Strategy 3C Feasibility** (Long-term goal)

**Current Priority:** User will indicate which to research first.

---

## 🔧 **Integration with Existing Rules**

### **Works With:**

- **Documentation Management:** Single-focus ensures accurate docs
- **Device Changelog:** Updates reflect focused, complete work
- **Git Workflow:** Commit after completing one topic
- **Dynamic Pathing:** Can focus on device-specific research

### **Enforced By:**

- AI assistant self-monitoring
- User feedback on information quality
- Commit message patterns (one topic per commit)
- Documentation review process

---

## 💡 **User Can Override**

The user can explicitly request multi-topic work:

- "Research both X and Y together"
- "Compare A vs B vs C in one document"

But the AI should warn about potential information integrity risks.
